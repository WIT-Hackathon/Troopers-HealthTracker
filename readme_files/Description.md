## Problem Statement:

We are in a world now where we have accepted to live with COVID-19 by social distancing, with the relaxation of the lockdown rules, warnings are being sounded about a possible resurgence of Corona cases – a so-called second wave. Hence, identifying the infected persons quickly and efficiently is the key to restrict the pandemic further.

## Goal:

Goal in these circumstances is to make people feel safe, stressless and also to reduce the burden on Govt. While Govt is in rush to identify the infected persons with multiple tests and quarantine them, we want to provide an efficient solution by avoiding those tests
and ensure people are comforatble at home with their families.

## Solution Proposed:

An application where medical professionals will be monitoring patient’s health information from time to time through a smart device/manual process. Based on patient’s health, medical professionals will take necessary actions like advising prescription, connect via chat bot ,suggestions for clinical tests, physical visit, etc., Thus Trooper Health Tracker will help to maintain medical professionals-patient relation by social distancing.


## Key Players:
Devices supported – Mobile, web, Smart devices
•	Patients: will upload their info in the application manually or through smart device.
•	Doctors:  will see the info, asses the condition of the patient and provide further suggestions
•	Chat bot: will enable virtual conversations for both patient and medical professional.

## Benefits:

•	All patient stats will be integrated on a central repo.
•	Doctors will review the stats and alert the patients at the right time.
•	Reduces Government’s cost in maintaining non-infected people in quarantine centers.
•	Patient and doctor can connect virtually
•	Patients are free to connect and have second opinion if needed.
